Simple Web interface to run the Docco code annotation tool. Setting up Docco is a bit of pain simply to make the documentation of your code look cool. Annotate allows you to simply paste, upload, or point to a public repository and have the annotated code, in HTML format, generated. 

Future plans: Allow for user accounts and then have it act like gist on steroids. Other users would then be allowed to comment on the code right from the UI. Emails will be sent out to those that wish to know about comments/changes.
